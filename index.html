    <p id="story">
      In a forgotten forest covered in endless fog, there lived a strange witch â€” Pagal Anabia.
      Her laughter echoed through the darkness, twisting the trees and waking shadows that should have slept forever.
      She mixed potions that glowed like fireflies and whispered to the wind as if it were alive.
      But one night, as the moon turned red, her spell went wrong.
      The ground trembled, the fire died, and her own voice cursed her name.
      With her last breath, she smiled and whispered, "Gagar will come back..."
      Then, silence â€” forever.
